# As-The-Rain-Falls
Weather App


As a bootcamp student I want to build an application that will allo be to practice what I have learned up to this point in class.

## User Story

```
AS A bootcamp student
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities as well as what it would take to make a weather application.
SO THAT I can practice my code and plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
